git has two types of repository:
-------------------------------- 
    1.local repository 
    2.remote repository 
Usually the total project code will be available in remote repository.
The current work of developer will be stored in local repository. 

New files will be created in working directory. 
Once work completed, we have to add these files to staging area.For this we have to use 
git add command. 

git add ===> Sending files from working directory to staging area. 
git commit ===> Staged changes will be moved to local repository.
git push ===> To move files from local repository to remote repository.
git clone ===> To create a new local repository from the remote repository. <-----------------
git pull ===> To get updated files from remote repository to local repository.
 
cloning ===> creating exactly duplicate copy
