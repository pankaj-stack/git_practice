git has two types of repository:
-------------------------------- 
    1.local repository 
    2.remote repository 
Usually the total project code will be available in remote repository.
The current work of developer will be stored in local repository. 

New files will be created in working directory. 
Once work completed, we have to add these files to staging area.For this we have to use 
git add command. 

git add ===> Sending files from working directory to staging area. 
git commit ===> Staged changes will be moved to local repository.
git push ===> To move files from local repository to remote repository.
git clone ===> To create a new local repository from the remote repository. <-----------------
git pull ===> To get updated files from remote repository to local repository.
 
cloning ===> creating exactly duplicate copy 

working directory--------->staging area----------->local repository------>remote repository
---------git add---------------->--------git commit------->-------git push-------->
                                                          <----git clone/git pull--

4.Modified

    1.Untracked:
    ------------ 
    Every new file will be created in working directory.GIT does not aware these new files, 
    such type of files are said to be in "Untracked" 

git status: To know staus of files in all areas.   

Created a file in working directory with some content ===> Untracked 
Once we add this file to staging area ===> Staged state 
        git add a.txt 

We have to commit changes from staged area to local repository ==> In repository/Commited state
        git commit -m 'commit message' 
If the file added to staging area or commited ===> tracked by git 
ls ---> It will list out all files in working directory. <--- linux command 
git ls-files ---> It will list out all files which are tracked by git <--- git command

Any file which is already tracked by git , but it is modified in working directory is said to 
be in modified state. 
    modified a.txt 

http://git-scm.com/download/win 
git-scm ===> Software Configuration Management 

project1

git init ---> To provide/create an empty repository to our workspace so that version control 
              is available to our working directory. 

git init 
git add a.txt b.txt 
git commit -m 'commit message' 
git commit -a -m 'commit message' <---- this command is used when your file is in staging area 

.git directory ---> hidden directory 
 
Once we create workspace, if we want version control, we require a repository ===> git 

git init --> Initialized empty Git repository in <your path> 
 

git status:
----------- 
It shows the current status of all files in each area , like 
    Untracked files
    modified files
    staged files  

If we  want concise output we have to use -s option i.e git status -s 

git add:
------- 
To add files from working directory to staging area/cache are/index area 
Once we added files to staging area, then git tracks these files and ready for commit. 
 
staging area :--> index area or cache area . 
It is logical/virtual area but not physical area.
