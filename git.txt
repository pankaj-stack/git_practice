git has two types of repository:
-------------------------------- 
    1.local repository 
    2.remote repository 
Usually the total project code will be available in remote repository.
The current work of developer will be stored in local repository. 

New files will be created in working directory. 
Once work completed, we have to add these files to staging area.For this we have to use 
git add command. 

git add ===> Sending files from working directory to staging area. 
git commit ===> Staged changes will be moved to local repository.
git push ===> To move files from local repository to remote repository.
git clone ===> To create a new local repository from the remote repository. <-----------------
git pull ===> To get updated files from remote repository to local repository.
 
cloning ===> creating exactly duplicate copy 

working directory--------->staging area----------->local repository------>remote repository
---------git add---------------->--------git commit------->-------git push-------->
                                                          <----git clone/git pull--

4.Modified

    1.Untracked:
    ------------ 
    Every new file will be created in working directory.GIT does not aware these new files, 
    such type of files are said to be in "Untracked" 

git status: To know staus of files in all areas.   

Created a file in working directory with some content ===> Untracked 
Once we add this file to staging area ===> Staged state 
        git add a.txt 

We have to commit changes from staged area to local repository ==> In repository/Commited state
        git commit -m 'commit message' 
If the file added to staging area or commited ===> tracked by git 
ls ---> It will list out all files in working directory. <--- linux command 
git ls-files ---> It will list out all files which are tracked by git <--- git command

Any file which is already tracked by git , but it is modified in working directory is said to 
be in modified state. 
    modified a.txt 

http://git-scm.com/download/win 
git-scm ===> Software Configuration Management 

project1

git init ---> To provide/create an empty repository to our workspace so that version control 
              is available to our working directory. 

git init 
git add a.txt b.txt 
git commit -m 'commit message' 
git commit -a -m 'commit message' <---- this command is used when your file is in staging area 
git commit -am 'commit message'

.git directory ---> hidden directory 
 
Once we create workspace, if we want version control, we require a repository ===> git 

git init --> Initialized empty Git repository in <your path> 
 

git status:
----------- 
It shows the current status of all files in each area , like 
    Untracked files
    modified files
    staged files  

If we  want concise output we have to use -s option i.e git status -s 

git add:
------- 
To add files from working directory to staging area/cache are/index area 
Once we added files to staging area, then git tracks these files and ready for commit. 
 
staging area :--> index area or cache area . 
It is logical/virtual area but not physical area. 

1) To add all files in current working directory 
	git add .  
    git add * 
    git add -A 

2) To add particular files 
    git add file1.txt file2.txt 

3) We can use even regular expression patterns also 
    git add *.java 
    git add *.txt 
    git add *.txt *.java 
     
git commit :
------------ 
    If we want to commit staged changes 
    git commit -m 'commit message' 

Unique commit id will be generated 
commit id/hash which is haxadecimal number of 40  characters 
For commit git records 
author name and mail id 
timestamp 
commit message 

create  mode 100644 file1.txt # <--- 
    100 ==> The types of file 
           100 means ascii text data 
    644 ==> file permissions 
    644 ==> file  permissions :rw-r--r-- 
    r--> 4 
    w--> 2 
    x--> 1 

git log:
-------- 
It show history of all commits. 
>commit id  
>author  name and mail id 
>timestamp 
>commit message      

HEAD ------------> MASTER----------------> (POINTING TO THE LATEST COMMIT)  

git log --help 

git config:
----------- 
git config command can be used for git configuration like user name, mail id, etc 
git config --list 
    To listout all git configurations 

git config user.name 
    pankaj-stack 
    
git config user.email
    80783685+pankaj-stack@users.noreply.github.com  

git config --list # To list out all the configurations 

without global vs with global:
------------------------------ 
For all repositories which is managed by current git ==> global 
with global means : configurattion applicable for all repositories 
without global means: configurations applicable only for current repository 

github and gitlab are  the remote repositories <---------------------------------------- 
 
How to see log information of a particular file:
------------------------------------------------ 
git log file1.txt  

oneline per commit 
commit id (7 characters only) + commit message 

git log --oneline #<--- This option is very helpful if we have lot of commits and to identify
                        commit based on message. 

Option-2: -n option to limit the number of commits to display 
git log -n 2 --oneline 
git log -2 
git log --max-count=3 
 
Option-3: --grep option to search basedf on given pattern in the commit message. 
did some changes for sr-231 
did some changes for defect no. 123 
did some changes for commit message 

git log --grep=pattern 
git log --grep=sr-231  

Option-4: Show commits more recent than a specific data or time 
git log --since='2022-05-25' 
git log --after='2022-05-25' 
git log --after='10 days ago' 
git log --after='3 hours ago'  

Option-5: Show commits older than a specific time 
git log --util='17-05-2022' 
git log --before='17-05-2022' 
git log --before='5 minutes ago' 
git log --before='1 day ago'  
 
Option-6: Show commits on the basis of author 
--author =<pattern> <---------------- 
git log --author='Durga'
  
Option-7: --decorate option to display extra information 
-------------------------------------------------------- 
    branch name,HEAD,tags inoformation etc 

git log --decorate

2.working directory vs last commit:
-----------------------------------  
HEAD --------> MASTER-------------> latest commit ,
         indirectly HEAD is pointing to the lated commit(last commit )
         git diff HEAD file1.txt <---- compare last commit and working directory
         git diff --staged file1.txt  

3.staging area vs specific commit:
---------------------------------- 
        git diff --staged commit_id file1.txt  

4.Between two specified commits:
-------------------------------- 
        git diff commit_id_1 commit_id_2 file1.txt 

        git diff 5ac0761 a9bed75 file1.txt 

5) last commit vs last but one commit(second last):

        git diff HEAD HEAD^1 file1.txt

6) compare all files:
--------------------- 
git diff commit_id_1 and commit_id_2 

git diff e7bc049 a9bed75  

                            from 11:23 --------------- 12:23
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
7) local repo vs remote repo:
----------------------------- 
git diff local_branch_name remote_branch_name 
git diff master remote_branch_name 

Visual tool for checking differences:
------------------------------------- 
Helix Visual Merge Tool(p4merge) 
Meld 
etc ... 

p4merge ===> Merge tool as well as Diff tool 

SVN, CVS, ClearCase, Perforce 

Perforce 4 merge ===> p4merge  

-----------------------------To remove files from different areas-----------------------------
git rm command: 
--------------
1.To remove files from both staging area and working directory (git rm file_name)
2.To remove files from only staging area but not from working directory 
3.To remove files only from working directory
 
1.To remove files from both staging area and working directory
    > git rm file_name
Note: 
    >git rm
    >fatal: No pathspec was given. Which files should I remove? 

    >git rm .
    >fatal: not removing '.' recursively without -r

    >git rm -r . # to delete all the files of the working directory and staging area

2.To remove files from only staging area but not from working directory 
    >git rm --cached file_name 

3.To remove files only from working directory
    > we simply use only normal linux command 
    > rm file_name  

-----------------------------------------git checkout command-----------------------------------------
We can use checkout command to discard unstaged changes in the tracked files working directory 
unstaged changes : The changes which are not added to the staging area 
tracked files : The files which are tracked by git 

1. git checkout
    > It will list out the files for which checkout is applicable  
2. git checkout file1.txt  
    > To discard unchanged changes in file1.txt
3. git checkout . 
    > To discard unchanged changes in every tracked files of working directory.

git checkout filename(that file name should be staging area wheter it is deleted from the staging area it does not matter)

After checkout 
    >working directory copy and staging area copy have same content
